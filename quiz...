1. What is the mass of a photon?
A photon has no mass. Its mass is energy.
2. What is the size of a quark?
> 10 to the-35; < 10 to the -15 meters
3. What is the difference between electrical charge and color charge?
- Electric charge is the property of matter.
- Color charge is the property of quarks and gluons.
4. Explain the difference between a boson and a fermion.
- A fermion can’t have 2 charges in the same state.
- A boson can have charges in the same sate.
5. Describe what type of particle are both a boson and a hadron. Example.
Everything that is mad of quarks can be boson and hadron.
Ex: Baryons.
6. Explain the purpose of a bubble chamber.
A bubble chamber is used to detect particles.
7. What are leptons made of?
Leptons are made of electron-like particles.
8. Name 2 leptons and 2 baryons:
- Leptons: electrons, muons.
- Baryons: protons, neutrons.
9. Explain what quantities are conserved at each vertex of a Feynman’s diagram.
- Vertical: time.
- Horizontal: space.
10. Explain what an “exchange particle” is. Include its function and provide example.
Gluon act as exchange particles for the strong force between quarks and particles made of quarks.
Ex: protons-neutrons interaction.
